# Corromics
Corromics is a web-based application designed to uncover correlation patterns between microbiome and metabolome data. By integrating microbial (e.g., ASV sequences) or other omics information with metabolite information, Corromics constructs a network where each microbial entity and metabolite is represented as a node. Edges are drawn between nodes to visualize their interactions, helping users discern meaningful relationships between microbial communities and metabolic profiles. This tool facilitates a deeper understanding of microbial-metabolite associations, enabling insights into functional dynamics in diverse biological systems.
